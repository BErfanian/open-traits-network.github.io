We have developed a new website to help coordinate the Open Traits Network initiative. You can become a member by creating a member page at GitHub. Follow this [link](https://github.com/open-traits-network/open-traits-network.github.io/blob/master/_members) and follow the instruction at the bottom of the page. You can register trait datasets [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWL1hMzSGOfSSOGDFhjwipT1a1j9XSLpiDoI0ziTEMywsW7w/viewform?usp=sf_link).
