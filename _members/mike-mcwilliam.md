Mike is a coral ecologist based in Hawaii.

## Collaboration statement
I'm broadly interested in the diversity and biogeography of organisms (mostly corals) and how human activities are influencing ecosystem functions. My work so far has explored the global biogeography of coral trait space and used traits to test the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function on coral reefs. In the future I hope to continue to use traits or trait space to gain a better understanding of the forces that drive individual, population, and ecosystem performance. I hope this work will utilise and supplement the OTN.
