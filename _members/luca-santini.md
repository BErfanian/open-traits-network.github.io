Luca is a researcher in conservation biogeography and macroecology based in Rome, Italy. 



## Collaboration statement

Most of my research is at the interface between macroecology, biogeography, conservation biology and global change biology. My research relies heavily on biodiversity and trait databases, and I produced one myself (TetraDENSITY) that collates population density estimates for terrestrial vertebrates worldwide.
