Fatih is a plant ecologist based in Ordu, Turkey. 

## Collaboration statement

I completed my Ph.D in 2016 at UNSW Australia. I am interested in phenotypic plasticity, ecological specialization, plant responses, species distributions, and climate change. My methods include both theoretical (e.g., meta-analysis and GIS) and empirical approaches (e.g., greenhouse experiments). I am always keen to collaborate in research projects/networking/data sharing so feel free to contact me with any offers/questions you might have.

May the plasticity be with you!
