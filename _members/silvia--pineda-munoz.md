Silvia is a conservation paleoecologist based in Atlanta, GA, USA. 

## Research profile

I work to understand ecological and evolutionary processes at multiple temporal, geographical and taxonomic scales. I use trait data to investigate macroecological patterns in modern and ancient ecosystems. 


Specially interested in mammal dental evolution and biogeography and the role functional traits play on structuring mammal communities.

Affiliated with the Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems program at NMNH Smithsonian Institution. I used to be the manager for ETE Assemblage/dessemblage database.
