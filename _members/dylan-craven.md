Dylan is a plant ecologist and biographer based in Santiago, Chile. 

## Collaboration statement

I am interested in temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity change and its implications. I am particularly fascinated by the role of biodiversity in driving the capacity of ecosystems to resist and recover from global change drivers.

I can offer expertise in combining and cleaning data from disparate sources and am keen to get a regional working group for South America started.
