My group is interested in the physical processes linking environmental variation to plant physiology, and how this “scales up” to influence higher-level patterns and processes.  To investigate these topics, we use interdisciplinary approaches that draw upon fields such as physics, chemistry, engineering, and geoscience.  Our work often involves development of mechanistic theory and models, which are parameterized, tested, and refined using data from the laboratory and the field.  We also focus on long-term monitoring of climate, ecophysiology, and vegetation dynamics at a growing network of plots located around the world.
