## Collaboration statement
I am interested in how global change affect alpine plant popualtions and communities. I use large scale experimental and gradient approaches as well as plant functional traits to studies these questions. I'm involved in a collection of plant traits along elevational gradients across the globe (soon to be open available). These trait campaigns are organized around field courses for students to learn about trait based and climate change ecology and data management (PFTC courses).

I can offer expertise in datamanagement and reproducible workflow in large research projects, such as large trait campaigns. And I'm always happy to discuss trait based and climate change ecology.
