Jonas is a biogeography enthusiast based in Antwerp, yet working on global questions. 

## Collaboration statement
I play a leading role in two international networks with ties to plant traits: MIREN, the Mountain Invasion Research Network (www.mountaininvasions.org) and SoilTemp, a global database of soil temperature time series (soiltemp.weebly.com). I can thus contribute expertise on the broader biogeographical patterns in plant traits. My geographical focus lies on mountain environments, where I study how local climate and land use shape these plant traits. 
Always looking for: in-situ measured soil temperatures linked to trait observations to feed in to the SoilTemp database.
