## Existing openscience trait datasets
Temperate and tropical macroinvertebrate body length, body width, body mass from a paper offering length-mass regressions for temperate and tropical invertebrates:

Sohlström, E.H., Marian, L., Barnes, A.D., Haneda, N.F., Scheu, S., Rall, B.C., Brose, U. & Jochum, M. (2018) Applying generalized allometric regressions to predict live body mass of tropical and temperate arthropods. Ecology and Evolution, 8, 12737–12749.

## Collaboration statement:
I have done field surveys and experimental field research in boreal, temperate and tropical areas and across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Currently, I am working on exotic earthworm invasion in North American forests in the EcoWorm project (https://www.idiv.de/en/groups_and_people/core_groups/experimental_interaction_ecology/research_fields.html) run by Nico Eisenhauer at iDiv, Leipzig, Germany. 

I have mostyl worked with macroinvertebrates / arthropods, but recently also synthesized vascular plant trait data from TRY to compare plant communities of biodiversity experiments to those from related real-world systems (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/725812v1).

Not all my data is published open access, yet, but I am always open to sharing data and collaborate on questions of joint interest. Please do get in touch if any of my research or data (see http://maltejochum.de/) sounds interesting.
