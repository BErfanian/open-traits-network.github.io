### Collaboration statement

My research is primarily focused around local adaptation, previously I worked on birds for my PhD thesis and now I have focused on native Australian plants and the strategies they employ to adapt to different climates. For my postdoc at CSIRO I want to combine information from plant functional traits (to summaries life history strategies, these data are from the new AusTraits database) and RNA sequencing data (to quantify physiological traits important for responding to heat stress) to identify species vulnerable to climate change.
