## Presentation
I am an evolutionary biologist and systematic botanist with a broad interest in flowering plant macroevolution. A key focus of my research is to unravel and better understand large-scale patterns in the evolution of flowers, combining molecular phylogenies, the fossil record, and databases of plant morphology. I currently work as a Research Scientist at the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domains Trust in Sydney. For more information, visit www.sauquetlab.org.
## Collaboration statement
My main focus at the moment is on flowering plant traits, both structural and functional, particularly floral traits. For this purpose, I have designed and developed a specific trait database called PROTEUS. Although PROTEUS itself is not open yet, our published trait datasets are. PROTEUS was originally created for the eFLOWER project, but many collaborators have also started to use it to record and archive plant trait data for other types of project. If you're interested in using PROTEUS for an upcoming or current project or are interested in collaborating with us, feel free to drop me an email. For more information, visit www.eflower.org.
