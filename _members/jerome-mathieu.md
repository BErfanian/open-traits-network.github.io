Jerome works mostly on soil organisms

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy performing comparative analyses of animals. So far, I worked mostly on soil organisms, especially earthworm. For instance, I released a global database on ontogenic growth of this group (EGrowth), with a GUI (in Shiny) to explore the database. Everything is on GitHub. I am about to release another version about reproductive traits of earthworm. 

I am currently developing a database on ecological stoichiometry of terrestrial animals.
I can offer expertise in data management and reproducible workflow in R.
