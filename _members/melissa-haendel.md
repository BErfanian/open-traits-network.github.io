Melissa is an ontologist and translational scientist based in Corvallis, Oregon. 

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working on translational and open science problems in biomedicine. I am also interested in phenomics in health, evolutionary biology, and biodiversity contexts.  I co-lead the Monarch Initiative, which is program that aims to semantically integrate genotype-phenotype data from across many animal species to support disease diagnosis and mechanistic discovery. We are also the developers of a number of ontologies, such as the Uberon anatomy ontology, the Human Phenotype ontology, the uPheno Ontology, and the Ontology of Biological Attributes (OBA).

I can offer expertise in data modeling and phenotype representation. I also love connecting people together around traits by running working groups, hosting visitors in my lab, organizing symposia at conferences. We have a small conference grant that supports these activities in the area of phenomics.
