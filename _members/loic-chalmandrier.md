## Collaboration statement
My research focuses on the analysis of plant communities structure, mostly through the lens of functional traits. More precisely, I am developing new statistical methodologies designed to take full advantage of functional trait data to understand plant coexistence and dynamics. 

I can offer expertise in those areas and  I am also happy to more generally participate to the Open Traits initiative.
