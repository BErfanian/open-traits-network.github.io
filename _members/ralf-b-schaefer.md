Ralf is an aquatic stress ecologist based in Landau, Germany.

## Collaboration statement
I work on the responses of microbial and invertebrate communities, predominantly in freshwater ecosystems, to anthropogenic stressors. I have been involved in assembling an Australian trait database for invertebrates (https://ausrivas.ewater.org.au/index.php/resources2/category/4-software-downloads - see paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106280) and I am leading a project to unite aquatic invertebrate databases from different continents, where a first version will be ready in the coming months.

I can offer expertise in assembling and cleaning trait data from different sources - we are currently writing a paper how different decisions to aggregate affect the outcome of analyses - and am happy to provide data etc. for larger analyses across organism groups or actually lead such analyses. Also would be happy to host visitors in my group and organise - perhaps virtual - meetings
