Maria is a Biodiversity Informatics specialist based in Heredia, Costa Rica. 

## Collaboration statement
I enjoy working on applied problems in biodiversity conservation using computer science algorithms and software tools. 

I can offer expertise in machine learning, big data, data mining and capacity building. I have applied some of these topics in my research projects and recently I received a one-year training at ITCR on these topics. My interest is to use the knowledge acquired to apply it in the extraction of traits from specimens and scientific publications about Costa Rica biodiversity.
