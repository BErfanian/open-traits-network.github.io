Ignasi is a community ecologist based in Seville, Spain. 



## Collaboration statement

I am broadly interested in understanding how global change drivers impact community structure and composition, and how those impacts translate to the ecosystem functioning. I like to work with plant-pollinator communities because they show complex responses to land use change, climate warming or biological invasions, and encapsulate a critical ecosystem function, pollination.



I often work with bee traits and I am working in compiling an open database on bee traits.
