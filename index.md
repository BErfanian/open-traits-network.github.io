The Open Traits Network (OTN) is a global, decentralised community of researchers and institutions focused on standardising and integrating trait data across all organisms. We are guided by the principles of Open Science, particularly Open Methods, Open Source and Open Data. We believe that five key principles built upon Open Science ideals could be transformative for trait science:

- Openly sharing data, methods, protocols, code, and workflows;
- Appropriately citing original data collectors, and providing scholarly credit;
- Providing appropriate metadata together with trait observations;
- Collecting of trait data following reproducible, standardised methods and protocols (when 	available) or committing to their development;
- Providing training resources in trait collection and database construction using Open Science 	principles.

To join the Open Traits Network subscribe to our [Mailing List](/subscribe) and offer your expertise and knowledge in the pursuit of a harmonised and curated trait dataset across all organisms.
